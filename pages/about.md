# **About Me**

<br>
<font size="+1">
Robotics represents harmony between creativity and engineering to me — a field where ideas take physical form and machines extend human potential. My passion for robotics was sparked during an embedded microcontroller course at Istanbul Technical University, I discovered how software and electronics could work together to create intelligent systems. That basic knowledge help me develop my bachelor’s thesis project on quadrotor control, which also introduced me to the Robot Operating System (ROS). This project became the foundation for my choise toward a career in robotics. Although I later enrolled in a Master’s program to solidify my knowledge, I ultimately chose to focus on gaining international experience and continuing my journey in Canada. I still value the experience I had during that time.
<br><br>
Earlier in my career, I spent a couple of years working in the robotics industry with mobile and warehouse robots, tasked with robot perception and navigation. This hands-on period allowed me to integrate control theory, sensor fusion, and real-world implementation to build systems capable of autonomous decision-making. To further expand my knowledge, I’ve completed several online programs. Most recent one is Robotics Masterclass of The Construct, which provided comprehensive coverage of modern robotics concepts and prepared me to work confidently with ROS2 and another one is the Self-Driving Car Specialization course, broadened my view to autonomous cars.

Through this portfolio, I share my journey of exploration, learning, and creations in the ever-evolving world of robotics. Welcome.
