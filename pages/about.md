# **About Me**

<br>
<font size="+1">
My interest in robotics stems from the intersection of software, electronics, and control systems — where theoretical concepts evolve into intelligent, autonomous machines capable of interacting with the physical world. The spark for this interest began during an embedded microcontroller course at Istanbul Technical University, where I first realized how software and electronics could cooperate to create intelligent systems. That foundational experience led to my bachelor’s thesis on quadrotor control, introducing me to the Robot Operating System (ROS) and shaping my career direction toward robotics.
<br><br>
Earlier in my career, I spent a couple of years working in the robotics industry, primarily with mobile and warehouse robots, where I was tasked with robot perception primarily and also navigation. This period provided me basic undersanding of small-medium robotics businesses and lots of hands-on programming practices. While I had enrolled in a Master’s program to strengthen my technical foundation, I ultimately left it unfinished to focus on gaining international experience and continuing my professional journey in Canada.
<br><br>
To expand my expertise, I’ve been working on online courses/programs, develop personal robotics projects and contributing to open-source initiatives such as ROS2. The most recent program was The Construct’s Robotics Masterclass, which provided in-depth coverage of ROS2 and modern robotics concepts. I also completed the Self-Driving Car Specialization, broadened my understanding of autonomous vehicle systems.
<br><br>
Through this portfolio, I share my journey of exploration, learning, and creation in the ever-evolving world of robotics. Welcome.
