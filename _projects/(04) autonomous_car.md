# [Self-Driving Car Specialization](https://github.com/kuralme/self_driving_car_specialization)

Through Coursera's Self-Driving Car Specialization, I developed practical skills in autonomous vehicle technology. The program covered essential areas including perception, planning, control, and state estimation. Using the CARLA simulator, I implemented real-world autonomous driving solutions. Here are the key outcomes from each course:

## 1. Introduction to Self-Driving Cars

- Taxonomy of self-driving cars
- Driving decisions and actions
- Hardware and software stacks
- Safety assessment and industry approach
- Kinematic and dynamic modeling
- Longitudinal and lateral controller design
- Control stack on CARLA racetrack

## 2. State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars

- Squared error optimization and Least squares
- The linear, extended, error-state and unscented kalman filters
- Pose estimation with GNSS/INS
- Lidar sensing and point clouds
- Vehicle state estimator

## 3. Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars

- Basics of 3D computer vision
- Visual Features
- Feedforward and CNN
- 2D object detection
- Semantic segmentation

- Decompose the motion planning problem into a hierarchical structure
- Static occupancy grids
- Mission planning on road networks
- Reactive planning and collision checking
- Behavioral planning
- Smooth local planning
- Motion planning in CARLA simulation
